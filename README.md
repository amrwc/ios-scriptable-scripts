# iOS Scriptable Scripts

-   Scriptable app: https://apps.apple.com/app/scriptable/id1405459188
-   Scriptable website: https://scriptable.app

## Importing a script through iCloud Drive

1. Save the script as a `.js` file.
    - Remember about the necessary comments near the top, similar to the following.
    ```JavaScript
    // Variables used by Scriptable.
    // These must be at the very top of the file. Do not edit.
    // icon-color: deep-green; icon-glyph: magic;
    ```
    - The file name is the title of the script in the app.
2. Put the file in the `Scriptable` directory in iCloud Drive.

The script should be automatically imported inside of the Scriptable app.
